## 💻 ICT Integration in Teaching and Learning

As a passionate advocate for digital literacy and technology in education, I have actively contributed to integrating ICT tools in teaching and learning environments, especially in underserved communities and public schools.

### 🏫 Key Teaching Initiatives

- **Digital Literacy Training for Students and Teachers**  
  Facilitated hands-on training sessions on using productivity tools (Google Workspace, Microsoft Office), internet safety, and online research for both students and teachers.

- **E-Learning Tools in the Classroom**  
  Guided educators on incorporating digital platforms such as YouTube, Google Classroom, and Open Educational Resources (OERs) into lesson delivery and student engagement.

- **Device Setup & ICT Infrastructure Support**  
  Helped schools set up and maintain computer labs, tablets, and projectors for daily use in classrooms.

- **Capacity Building Workshops**  
  Organized ICT capacity-building workshops under programs like **DEGESI** and **Cyber Shujaa**, focused on equipping teachers with 21st-century digital skills.

### 🧠 Impact

- Empowered over 1000 learners and 50+ teachers with foundational and intermediate digital skills.
- Improved learning outcomes through interactive and blended learning methods.
- Enhanced digital inclusion in marginalized areas like **Garissa** and **Turkana County**.
